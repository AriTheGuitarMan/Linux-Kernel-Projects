# Linux-Kernel-Projects

This repository showcases several projects working on the Linux kernel, doing modifications on it, and learning new ways to manage the kernel. Whilst the Linux kernel used is a unique version called "Reptilian" which was used by my University, it is practically the same as any typical Linux kernel.

Four projects are shown. Each typically consisting of a tar.gz file containing the changed file contents of the kernel modification challenge, a diff file, a report, and specifications.

Thank you.
